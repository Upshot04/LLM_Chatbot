# LLM_Chatbot
In the contemporary era of digitalization, chatbots have become integral tools for customer service and information retrieval. This project focuses on developing a chatbot to provide detailed information about MBA programs. The chatbot is built using the GPT-2 model, known for its advanced language generation capabilities, and deployed via Streamlit to ensure a seamless and interactive user experience.

The dataset used for training the chatbot consists of 50 manually curated question-and-answer pairs related to SCIT's MBA programs, covering various aspects such as program structure, fees, eligibility criteria, specializations, and campus life. The GPT-2 model is fine-tuned on this dataset to generate contextually relevant responses to user queries.

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Design and Interface: Detailed planning and design were undertaken to ensure the chatbot's functionality and user-friendliness. Key features include natural language understanding and real-time interaction capabilities.
2. Development: Utilizing LangChain/HuggingFace frameworks, the chatbot is trained and deployed. The code involves functions for reading different file types, loading datasets, training the GPT-2 model, and generating text responses.

Despite challenges with Streamlit and Flask during deployment, the project highlights the potential of NLP technologies to enhance user engagement and streamline information dissemination within educational contexts. Future work will focus on refining the chatbot's capabilities and improving its performance for better user satisfaction.

This repository contains all the necessary scripts and instructions to set up and run the chatbot, making it a valuable resource for anyone developing similar NLP applications.
